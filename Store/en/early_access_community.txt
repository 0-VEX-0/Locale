Community is a huge part of our plans. We plan to collect feedback and bug reports from our players and make it part of our daily development cycle. Whether it's making quick fixes, tweaks and additions to a more long term planning and architecting of big features.

Our primary method of providing feedback directly is through our public GitHub issue tracker. We will routinely watch and collect generalized feedback from Steam, Discord, Twitter, Reddit and other social media.

Our goal is to also integrate a feedback form directly in-game in the future, which will make it easier for users to provide feature requests and report issues without having to leave the game.

We want our community to feel like they're heard and part of the development process as much as our development resources allow.
