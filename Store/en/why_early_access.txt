Resonite is a project with a wide scope and despite already having extensive functionality, there are several core features that still have not yet been implemented, to reach what we would consider 'critical mass'. 

Our goal is to actively continue developing this project even after full release. We only consider it to be early, because we don't feel it's 'fully ready'.
