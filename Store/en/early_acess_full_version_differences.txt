There are number of key features we want to make happen for the full release. One of them being the addition of a marketplace - a place for the creators on the platform to share their creations with the rest of the community.

We definitely want to expand and polish the user experience, from UI and UX to building tools and ensuring smooth experiences to both casual and pro users.

Our plan is to also switch to a fully custom graphics engine and modern runtime, which will not only allow for significant performance optimizations, but also features such as live shader editing.

We are also considering the integration of WebAssembly, to expand the possibilities of content creation.

These are just some of the major features we would like to introduce before the platform is considered "ready" - the list is by no means exhaustive or final and we always adapt on the go.
