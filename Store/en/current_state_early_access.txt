The project is fully playable, usable and stable for daily use, with all the features listed on the store page "About This Game" section already fully implemented.

However, it's more rough around some edges than we'd like and there are major features that we plan to add. Some interactions are not very intuitive yet, resulting in a more difficult learning curve, some building tools that would make life easier are missing and more optimizations are needed overall for a smoother experience.
