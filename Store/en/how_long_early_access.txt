We expect roughly 2-3 years of active development to implement features, optimizations and tweaks before we consider the project to be in a polished enough state to take it out of early access.

We do not have plans to significantly alter our development cycle after full release and will continue adding new major features and optimizations thanks to the open ended nature of this project.
